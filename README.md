# weatherapp

Basic weather app that displays temperature, humidity, wind, and description of the city. 
Was unable to catch several edge cases:
- if user spells city incorrectly
- resetting the city image if it is not in the urban photos API

The photo API only works and very very specific cities. some that I tested which works are:
- chicago
- seoul
- paris
- tokyo
- london
